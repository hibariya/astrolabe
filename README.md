# Astrolabe

Astrolabe is an experimental tool that explains the relationships between a couple of English words utilizing [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/). The primary motivation of this is to help ESL learners (like me) to grasp a clearer picture of a particular sense by recognizing the relationships between two words that have something in common but different senses.

## Prerequisites

* build-essential or any equivalent environment
* Autoconf
* Automake
* Libtool
* WordNet with header files

For debian the following command will install them:

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool wordnet wordnet-dev
```

## Build

```shell
autoreconf --install && ./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/dist && make && make install
```

## Usage

Pass two words that have something in common: like `delete` and `remove`.

```
$ ./dist/bin/astrolabe delete remove

## About WordNet

> WordNetÂ® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser(link is external). WordNet is also freely and publicly available for download. WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.
